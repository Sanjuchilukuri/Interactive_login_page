#Interactive Login Page with Captcha Validation
This is an interactive login page developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login page consists of a username input field and a captcha field. The captcha is generated randomly and automatically refreshes whenever the web page is refreshed. The page also includes a refresh button to regenerate the captcha.
